This is the source code for my personal website [zafar.dev](https://zafar.dev), showcasing my work, experience, and thoughts on technology.

## About Me

I'm Zafar, a multi-industry code deleter and product-focused developer based in Tokyo, Japan. I specialize in creating useful and impactful products that make a real difference in people's lives.

With experience in designing, simplifying, building, and scaling solutions for startups using first-principle thinking, I've developed a strong track record of success in achieving clients' goals and objectives.

## My Approach

- Iterate fast, iterate often, and don't stop iterating
- Never say no, just dwell on it for a good moment
- Communication is key, there is no room for ego in pursuit of excellence
